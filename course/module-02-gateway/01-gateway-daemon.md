# The Gateway Daemon

> **Note:** 🚧 This lesson is coming soon. Content is under development.

## What to expect

This lesson will cover:
- How the Gateway starts up (launchd/systemd service)
- The startup sequence: config load → channel init → WS server bind → health check
- Health endpoint and diagnostics (`openclaw doctor`)
- Gateway logs and verbose mode
- Graceful shutdown and restart

---

*Check back soon. In the meantime, review the [gateway docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway).*
